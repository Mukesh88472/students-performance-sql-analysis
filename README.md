# 🎓 Student Performance SQL Analysis  
A complete SQL-based analysis on the **Student Performance Dataset** to understand how different demographic and educational factors influence academic scores.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores students' performance based on various attributes such as **gender, parental education, lunch type, race/ethnicity, and test preparation course completion**.  
The goal was to derive meaningful insights using **pure SQL queries** — without performing any prior cleaning on Excel.

---

## 📁 Dataset Details
**Dataset Name:** Student Performance Dataset  
**Source Format:** CSV  
**Rows:** ~1000  
**Columns:**
- gender  
- race/ethnicity  
- parental level of education  
- lunch  
- test preparation course  
- math score  
- reading score  
- writing score  

No data cleaning was done before loading — the dataset was directly imported into **PostgreSQL**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **PostgreSQL** (main SQL engine)
- SQL Aggregations
- GROUP BY, ORDER BY
- CASE WHEN statements
- Joins (if used)
- Subqueries
- Insight generation

## 🎯 Objectives (Questions Answered)
The major analysis involved answering:

### ✔️ Gender-based performance comparison  
### ✔️ Race/Ethnicity group analysis  
### ✔️ Impact of parental education level  
### ✔️ Influence of lunch type on scores  
### ✔️ Effect of test preparation course  
### ✔️ Subject-wise average scores  
### ✔️ Overall student performance summary  
### ✔️ Best and worst performing groups  

---

## 💡 Key Insights (Findings)
Based on SQL queries, here are the final insights:

- **Female students** scored higher in *reading* and *writing* compared to male students.  
- Students who completed the **test preparation course** performed significantly better in all subjects.  
- Those with **standard lunch** showed higher average scores than free/reduced lunch students.  
- Higher **parental education** (bachelor’s, master’s) led to higher student scores.  
- Race/Ethnicity groups showed clear variation, with some groups consistently performing better across subjects.

## 📑 Why No PDF Report?
Since SQL projects are best reviewed directly in `.sql` format and README.md, a PDF report is optional.  
Most recruiters prefer:
- Clean SQL files  
- A well-written README  
- Clear folder structure  

Hence the project uses **best practice standard format**.

It reflects the ability to:
- Work with relational datasets  
- Write analytical SQL queries  
- Compare group-level performance  
- Extract meaningful insights  
- Present results clearly
